This repo contains my solutions to tasks from Advent of Code.  
Code isn't pretty, solutions definitely are not the best possible ones, and it might not work with every possible input. Right now my only goal is to get the answer – nothing more and nothing less.

In time, I'll _maybe_ try to clean everything up, but right now I just committed my code as-is.

Code is written in PHP and obviously contains spoilers – read at your own risk!  
(Although I'm behind, and probably won't catch up, so you should be relatively fine)
